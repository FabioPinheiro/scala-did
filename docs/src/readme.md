# Scala-did

A Scala & Scala.js implementation of DID and DID Comm messaging spec.

DIDComm is a secure messaging protocol for decentralized identities (DIDs).
This library allows you to easily integrate DIDComm messaging into your application.

## Getting Started with Scala-did

To install ScalaDID in a scala project

```scala
 libraryDependencies += "app.fmgp" %% "did" % @VERSION@ // for DID and DID Comm
 libraryDependencies += "app.fmgp" %% "did-imp" % @VERSION@ // for crypto implementation
 libraryDependencies += "app.fmgp" %% "did-framework" % @VERSION@ //for utils
 libraryDependencies += "app.fmgp" %% "did-peer" % @VERSION@ // for resolver of the did method `peer`
 libraryDependencies += "app.fmgp" %% "did-web" % @VERSION@ // for resolver the did method `web`
 libraryDependencies += "app.fmgp" %% "did-uniresolver" % @VERSION@ // for calling the resolver uniresolver
```

In a crossProject for the JSPlatform and JVMPlatform this should be `%%%` instead of `%%`
