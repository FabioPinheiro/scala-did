The plan is to eventually have a fully functional implementation for JVM and JS platforms!

## TODO

- Have our implementation of:
  - AdditionalAuthenticatedData - https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7518#section-5
- Keep meta information when decrypting a message
- Fail if the message decrypted is authenticated but does not match the 'from' field
