    *   A string containing the permitted scheme for the protocol that the site wishes to handle. For example, you can
    *   register to handle SMS text message links by passing the "sms" scheme.
    * @param url
    *   A string containing the URL of the handler. This URL must include %s, as a placeholder that will be replaced
    *   with the escaped URL to be handled.
    * @return

    *   - The registered scheme (protocol) is invalid, such as a scheme the browser handles itself (https:, about:,
    *     etc.)
    *   - The handler URL's origin does not match the origin of the page calling this API.
    *   - The browser requires that this function is called from a secure context.
    *   - The browser requires that the handler's URL be over HTTPS.

    * @throws DOMException.SYNTAX_ERR
    *   The %s placeholder is missing from the handler URL
