# SCALA DID

A Scala/ScalaJS library for DID and DIDcomm.
The one of the main goals of this library is to make DID Comm v2 **type safety** and easy to use.

[**Scala-DID Documentation**](./docs/readme.md)

[![CI](https://github.com/FabioPinheiro/scala-did/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/FabioPinheiro/scala-did/actions/workflows/ci.yml)
[![Scala Steward](https://github.com/FabioPinheiro/scala-did/actions/workflows/scala-steward.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/FabioPinheiro/scala-did/actions/workflows/scala-steward.yml)
 - **CI** automate builds and tests all pushes to the master branch also as all PRs created.
 - **Scala Steward** automate the creation of pull requests for libraries with updated dependencies, saving maintainers time and effort. It can also help ensure that libraries are kept up-to-date, improving their reliability and performance.

## TODO/WIP

- We are still working on core API.
  - decrypting a file MUST be one of the following combinations: [See this like](https://identity.foundation/didcomm-messaging/spec/#iana-media-types)
- [TODO!] [Message Layer Addressing Consistency](https://identity.foundation/didcomm-messaging/spec/#message-layer-addressing-consistency)
- did-rotation: https://identity.foundation/didcomm-messaging/spec/#did-rotation
  - support `from_prior`
  - support `sub` `iss` on JWT https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7519
- [TODO] [return_route extension](https://github.com/decentralized-identity/didcomm-messaging/blob/main/extensions/return_route/main.md)
- create module for protocols
- method `did:jwk` https://github.com/quartzjer/did-jwk
- routing:
  - implement a mediator [WIP]
    - websocket
    - HTTP POST
    - push notification
  - implement a relay
    - [WIP] NFC
    - websocket
    - bluetooth
- maybe implement ["KERI lite"](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1ksqVxeCAvqLjr67htWZ4JYaSnI8TUZIO7tDMF5npHTo/edit#slide=id.g1ca1fd90f33_0_0)
- be part of the Adopters in https://github.com/sbt/sbt-ci-release/

## Benefits of type safety

- It would help prevent errors by ensuring that only valid DIDs are used, and that the library does not attempt to perform any invalid operations on them. This could help ensure that the library functions correctly and reliably.

- It would make the code easier to read and understand, by making it clear what types of values are being used and what operations are being performed on them. This could make it easier for developers to work with the library and understand its functionality. **Speeding up the development of applications**

- It could make the library more efficient, by allowing the compiler to optimize the code for working with DIDs. This could make the library run faster and more efficiently.

- It could improve the reliability and correctness of the library, by catching any errors or bugs related to invalid DIDs or invalid operations at compile time. This could save time and effort in the development process and help prevent potential issues in the final library.

I usually say if it compiles it probably also works!

NOTES:

- The things inside the group box (fmgp) are implemented on this repository and that are intended to be published as a library.
- Green boxes is JVM's platform specific.
- Blue boxes is JavaScript's platform specific.
- Other boxes are not platform specific.
- The `did-imp-hw` is a idea how to extend for other implementation. Lika a Hardware/platform specific.
- `did-resolver-web` & `did-resolver-peer` are implementations of the respective did methods.
